            one: "Captain. Yes, sir? Tell them we wish to board at once. With all due respect, the Ambassadors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately. Yes, yes, of course... as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to receive the Ambassador. I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please. We are greatly honored by your visit Ambassadors. Make yourselves comfortable. My master will be with you shortly. I have a bad feeling about this. I don't sense anything. It's not about the mission, Master, it's something... elsewhere... elusive. Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now where it belongs. But Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future... ... but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, my young Padawan. Yes, Master. How do you think the trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands? These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short. What?!? What did you say? The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe. I knew it! They're here to force a settlement. Distract them. I will contact Lord Sidious. Are you brain dead? I'm not going in there with two Jedi! Send the droid. Is it in their nature to make us wait this long? No... I sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute. What is it? ...This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious. The blockade is finished! We dare not go against these Jedi. Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slim in my sight again. This turn of events is unfortunate. We must accelerate our plans. Begin landing your troops. My Lord, is that legal? I will make it legal? And the Jedi? The Chancellor should have never brought them into this. Kill them, immediately. Yes. yes, My Lord. As you wish. Captain?! Look!! ...Sorry. Dioxin! Oh, excuse me. Check it out Corporal. We'll cover you. Roger, roger. Uh-oh, blast them... What is going on down there? We've lost the transmission, sir. Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir? Well, no, but I don't... Seal off the bridge. Yes sir. That won't be enough, sir. I want droidekas up here at once!!! We will not survive this. Close the blast doors!!! That will hold them. They're still coming through! This is impossible!! Where are those droidekas?! Master, destroyers. They have shield generators. It's a standoff! Let's go! They're no match for droidekas. Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft. Battle droids. It's an invisible army. This is an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet. You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were short. Sir, a transmission from the planet. It's Queen Amidala herself. At last we're getting results. Again you come before me, Your highness. You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy ... Your trade boycott of our planet has ended. I was not aware of such a failure. I'm aware the Chancellor's Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have been commanded to reach a settlement. I know nothing of any Ambassadors ... you must be mistaken. Beware, Viceroy... the Federation has gone too far this time. We would never do anything without the approval of the Senate. You assume too much. We will see. She's right, the Senate will never.... It's too late now. Do you think she suspects an attack? I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there. The negotiations haven't started because the Ambassadors aren't there? How could that be true? I have assurances from the Chancellor... his Ambassadors did arrive. It must be the... get... negotiate... Senator Palpatine?!? What's happening? Check the transmission generators... A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion. The Federation would not dare go that far. The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be finished. We must continue to rely on negotiation. Negotiation? We've lost all communications! ... and where are the Chancellors Ambassadors? This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army. I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war. Yes, Viceroy? Captain, we've searched the ship and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have got on onto one of your landing craft. If they are down here, sir, we'll find them. Use caution. These Jedi are not to be underestimated. Oh, noooooooooo! Quick! Get out of here! Get off! Whas dat? Hey wait! Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous! You almost got us killed! Are you brainless? I spake. The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get outta here! No... no! Mesa stay...Mesa culled Ja Ja Binksss. Mesa yous humble servaunt. That won't be necessary. Oh boot tit tis! Tis demunded byda guds it tis. Oh, nooooo! Stay down! Yousa sav-ed my again! What's this? A local. Let's go, before more of those droids show up. Mure? Mure did you spake??!? Ex-squeeze me, but de mosta safest place would be GungaCity. Tis where I grew up ... Tis a hidden city. A city! Uhhu. Can you take us there? Ahhh, ... on second taut ... no, not willy, no. No??! Iss embarrissing, boot ahh... My afrai my've bean banished. My forgoten der Bosses would do terrible tings to my. Terrible tings if my goen back dare. You hear that? Yeah. That's the sound of a thousand terrible things heading this way... If they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little pieces, then blast us into oblivion! Oh! Yousa point is well said. Dis way! Hurry! How much farther? Wesa goen underwater, okeyday? â€¦and my warning yous. Gungans no liken outsiders, so don't expicin wern welcome. Don't worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes. Ahh... yousa follow me now, okeyday? Sooo good beein home. Hey yousa, stopa there. Heyo-dalee, Cap'n Tarpals, Mesa back! Noah gain, Ja Ja. Yousa goen tada Bosses. Yousa in big dudu this time. How wude. Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of mackineeks up dare tis new weesong! That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn them. Wesa no like da Naboo! Da Naboo tink day so smarty. Day tink day brains so big. Once those droids take control of the surface, they will take control of you. Mesa no tink so. Dey not know of uss-en. You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle. What happens to one of you will affect the other. You must understand this. Wesa no care-n about da Naboo. Then speed us on our way. Wesa gonna speed yousaway. We could use a transport. Wesa give yousa una bongo. Da speedest way tooda Naboo tis goen through da core. Now go. Thank you for your help. We leave in peace. Master, what's a bongo? A transport, I hope. Daza setten yousa up. Goen through da planet core is bad bombin!! Ahhh... any hep hair would be hot. Master, we're short of time. We'll need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. This Gungan my be of help. What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here? Hisen to be pune-ished. I have saved his life. He owes me what you call a life debt. QUI-GON waves his hand. Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now. Binks. Yousa haveda liveplay with thisen hisen? Ah-huh. Begone wit him. Count mesa outta dis one! Better dead here, den deader in da core... Yee guds, whata mesa sayin?! Dis is nutsen... Ooo, gooberfish! Why were you banished, Jar Jar? Tis a longo taleo, buta small part of it wawdbe mesa... aaaa... clumsy. You were banished because you were clumsy? Ahh... Yousa mighten be sayin dat. Mesa cause-ed mabee one or duey lettal bitty axadentes...yud-say boom da gasser, un crash Der Bosses heyblibber...den banished. Uh-oh. Big gooberfish. Huge Opee. There's always a bigger fish. The invasion is on schedule, My Lord. I have the Senate bogged down in procedures. They will have no choice but to accept your control of the system. The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her. Queen Amidala is young and naive. You will find controlling her will not be difficult. Yes, My Lord. You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi? No need to report that to him, until we have something to report. Where wesa goin. Don't worry, the Force will guide us... Ooooh, maxibig... da Force ...Well, dat smells stinkowiff. we're losing power. Oh, no... Oh, wesa diein here. Just relax. We're not in trouble yet. What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak'n in here, all'n sink'n, and nooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINKEN WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!? Power's back. Relax. You overdid it. Head for that outcropping. Oie Boie! Viceroy, we have captured the queen. Ah, victory! Oo. Dis seem uverly. How will you explain this invasion to the Senate? The Queen and I will sign a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here. I assurances it will be ratified by the Senate. I will not co-operate. Now, now, your Highness. In time, the suffering of your people will persuade you to see our point of view. Commander? Yes, sir! Process them. Captain, take them to Camp Four. Roger, roger. We should leave the streets, your highness. Get their weapons. Woah. Yousa guys bombad! We're the Ambassadors, for the Supreme Chancellor. Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador. The negotiations never took place. It's urgent that we make contact with the republic. They've knocked out all our communications. Do you have transports? In the main hanger. This way. There are too many of them. That won't be a problem. Your Highness, under the circumstances, I suggest you come to Coruscant with us. Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people. They will kill you if you stay. They wouldn't dare. They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of theirs legal. They can't afford to kill her. There is something else behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you. Our only hope is for the Senate to side with us ...Senator Palpatine will need your help. Either choice presents great danger. â€¦to us all. We are brave, Your Highness. If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now. Then, I will plead our case to the Senate. Be careful, Governor. We need to free those pilots. I'll deal with that. Halt? I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking these people to Coruscant. Where are you taking them? To Coruscant. Coruscant!? Ahh, that doesn't compute. ... Ahh, wait! ... Ahh, you're under arrest! Go! Now stay here, and keep out of trouble. Ello, boyos. There's the blockade. The shield generator's been hit. How wude! We're loosing droids... fast. If we can't get the shield generators fixed, we'll be sitting ducks. The shields are gone. Powers back! That little droid did it... bypassed the main power drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum. There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant... the hyperdrive is leaking. We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship. Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The Trade Federation has no presence there. How can you be sure? It's controlled by the Hutts... You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are gangsters... If they discovered her ... It would be no different than if we landed on a system controlled by the Federation... except the Hutts aren't looking for her, which gives us an advantage. ...And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty? She has disappeared, My Lord. One Naboo cruiser got pat the blockade. I want that treaty signed. My Lord, it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range. ...not for a Sith. This is my apprentice. Darth Maul. He will find your lost ship. This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them. We should not have made this bargain. An extremely well put together little droid. Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives. It is to be commended...what is its number? R2-D2, Your Highness. Thank you, Artoo Detoo... Padme! Clean this droid up the best you can. It deserves our gratitude... Continue, Captain. Your Highness, with your permission we're heading for a remote planet called Tatooine. It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation. I do not agree with the Jedi on this. You must trust my judgment, Your Highness. Hidoe! Sorry. Whosa are yousa? I'm Padme. Mesa Ja Ja Binksss... You're a GUNGAN, aren't you? Ah-huh. How did you end up here with us? My no know... mesa day starten pitty okeyday witda brisky morning munchen. Den boom.... getten berry skeered, un grabbed dat Jedi, and before mesa knowen it... pow! Mesa here. getten berry berry skeered. That's it. Tatooine... There's a settlement. Land near the outskirts. We don't want to attract any attention. The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master. That'll complicate things. Be wary... I sense a disturbance in the Force. I feel it also, Master. Don't let them send any transmissions. Dis sun doen murder ta mesa skin. Wait! Wait. Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you. No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport is not going to be pleasant... The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this planet. This is not a good idea. Stay close to me. â€¦moisture farms for the most part. Some indigenous tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one are havens for those who do not wish to be found... like us. Dissen berry berry bad. (steps in ooze) Ooooh... icky... icky... goo. We'll try one of the smaller dealers. Good day to you. What do you want? I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian. Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. Boy, get in here! Now! My droid here has a readout of what I need. What took you so long? I was cleaning the bin like you... Watch the store. I've got some selling to do here. Soooo, let me take - a thee out back. Ni you'll find what you need. Don't touch anything. Are you an angel? What? An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They are the most beautiful creatures in the universe. They live on the Moons of Iego I think. You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much. I listen to all the traders and starpilots that come by here. I'm a pilot, you know, and some day I'm gonna fly away from this place. You're a pilot? All my life. How long have you been here? Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces. You're ... a slave? I am a person! My name is Anakin. I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. This is a strange place to me. Hey... Wha? Hit the nose! Oh! A T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I'm the only one hereabouts who has one... but thee might as well buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, I think... Saying of which, how's thee going to pay for all this? I have 20,000 Republic dataries. Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real... I don't have anything else. But credits will do fine. No they won'ta. Credits will do fine. No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that. We're leaving. Jar Jar? I'm glad to have met you. I was glad to meet you too. Outlanders! They think they know everything. They seemed nice to me. Clean the racks... then you can go home. ...and you're sure there's nothing left on board? A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe. But not enough for you to barter with. Not in the amounts you're talking about. All right. I'm sure another solution will present itself. I'll check back later. Noah gain... Noah gain da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be robbed un crunched. Not likely. We have nothing of value, that's our problem. Are you going to pay for that? It costs seven wupiupi. Chuba!! Ooops. Is this yours? Who, mesa? Careful, Sebulba... He's a big time outlander... I'd hate to see you diced before we race again. Next time we race, boy, it will be the end of you! If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you now. Yeah, it'd be a pity if you had to pay for me. Hi! Hi there. Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange goo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba. Mesa haten crunchen. Dat's da last ting mesa wanten. Nevertheless, the boy is right ... you were heading for trouble... Thanks, my young friend. But... but... mesa doen nutteen! This storm will slow them down. It looks pretty bad. Panaka? We're receiving a message from home. We'll be right there. Here, you'll like these pallies... Here. Thank you. Oh, my bones are aching ... storm's coming up, Annie. You'd better get home quick. Do you have shelter? We'll head back to our ship. Is it far? It's on the outskirts. You'll never reach the outskirts in time... sandstorms are very, very dangerous. Come on! I'll take you to my place. Mom! Mom! I'm home. Dissen cozy. These are my friends, Mom. Hidoe! I'm Qui-Gon Jinn. I'm building a droid. You wanna see? Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter. Come on! I'll show you Threepio! Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet. He's wonderful! You really like him? He's a protocol droid... to help Mom. Watch! Oh, oh. Where is everybody? Oh, hello, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How might I serve you? He's perfect. Oh, perfect. When the storm is over, I'll show you my racer. I'm building a Podracer! Artoo-Detoo. A pleasure to meet you. I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. I beg your pardon ...what do you mean, naked? My parts are showing? My goodness. ...the death toll is catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes... you must contact me ... It's a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind. It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace. What if it is true and the people are dying? Either way, we're running out of time. Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master. Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no difficulty in taking the Queen to Naboo to sign the treaty. At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge. You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will be no match for you. All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere. I've been working on a scanner to try and locate mine. Any attempt to escape... ...and they blow you up ...boom! How wude. I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The Republic's anti-slavery laws... The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own. 'Scuse me. Has anybody ever seen a Podrace? They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous. I'm the only human who can do it. You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods. Don't do that again. You're a Jedi Knight, aren't you? What makes you think that? I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon. Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him. I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi. I wish that were so... I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here to free all the slaves... have you come to free us? No, I'm afraid not ... I think you have ...why else would you be here? I can see there's no fooling you ...We're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic, on a very important mission. How did you end up here in the outer rim? Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it. I can help! I can fix anything! I believe you can, but first we must acquire the parts we need... Wit no-nutten mula to trade. These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind. Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races. Podracing ... Greed can be a powerful ally. I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. Anakin! Watto won't let you... Watto doesn't know I've built it. You could make him think it's yours, and get him to let me pilot it for you. I don't want you to race. It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it. But Mom, I love it. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need. Anakin! Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who might help us? Mom... you said the biggest problem in the universe is nobody helps each other...  I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We'll find some other way... No, there is no other way... I may not like it, but... he can help you... he was meant to help you. Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know. The Queen will not approve. The Queen does not need to know. Well, I don't approve. The boy tells me you wanta sponser him in a race. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think, huh. My ship will be the entry fee. Oh, not bad... not bad... ah Nubian, ah. It's in good order, except for the parts I need. ...what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last race. It will take some time to fix it. Ahhhh... it wasn't my fault really... Sebulba flashed me with his vents. I actually saved the Pod... mostly. That you did huh. The boy is good, no doubts there huh. Well, I have acquired a Pod in a game of chance. The fastest ever built. I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. So, you supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings fifty-fifty, I think. If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need... If we lose, you keep my ship. Either way, you win. Deal! Your friend is a follish one, methinks. What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here for a long time. Well, it's too dangerous to call for help now. A ship without a power supply isn't gonna get us anywhere, and... there is something about this boy... You should be proud of your son. He gives without any thought of reward. Well he knows nothing of greed. He has a... He has special powers. Yes... He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait. He deserves better than a slave's life. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early. The Force is unusually strong with him, that much is clear. Who is his father? There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him, I can't explain what happened. Can you help him? I don't know. I didn't actually come here to free slaves. Wow, a real Astro Droid... how'd you get so lucky? This isn't the half of it. I'm entered in the Boonta Race tomorrow! What? With this?? You are such a joker, Ani. You've been working on that thing for years. It's never gonna run. Come on, let's go and play ball. Keep racing, Ani, you're gonna be bug squash. Hey! Jar Jar! Keep away from those energy binders... If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours. Ouch muy tonge is fat. Muy togne. Oucho. (Gibberish) Hey! Ou-oh. Ow, hey, I'm stuck. You know, I find that Jar Jar creature very... odd. You don't even know if this things gonna run. It will. I guess it's time we found out. Here use this power charge. Come on Kitster. Lets move away. Mm... my mout. I'm stuck. Hep I'm s.. Muy tonge is fat... You're quite right. He's very odd indeed. Ow, th... thank yous. It's working! It's working! Stay still, Ani. Let me clean this cut. There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets? Most of them. Has anyone been to them all? Not likely. I want to be the first one to see them all... Annie, bedtime! ...Ouch! There we are, good as new... Ani! I'm not going to tell you again! What are you doing? Checking your blood for infections. You have a big day tomorrow. Goodnight. Obi-Wan... Yes, Master. I need an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you. Wait a minute... I need a midi-chlorian count. The reading's off the chart... over twenty thousand. Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high! No Jedi has. What does that mean? I'm not sure. ...I wanta see your spaceship the moment the race is over. Patience, my good friend. You'll have your winnings before the suns set, and we'll be far away from here. Not if your ship belongs to me, I think... I warn you, no funny business. You don't think Anakin will win? Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think. Oh-no! Why do you think that? He always wins. I'm betting heavily on Sebulba. I'll take that bet. You'll what??!! I'll wager my new racing pod against... say... the boy and his mother. No Pod's worth two slaves... not by a long shot. The boy, then... We'll let fate decide, huh. I just happen to have a chance cube here. Blue it's the boy, red his mother... You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won't win the race, so ...it makes little difference. Better stop your friends betting or I'll end up owning him too. What'd he mean by that? I'll tell you later. Goodmorning. Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous. I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships! This is so wizard Ani! I'm sure you'll do it this time. Do what? Finish the race, of course! You've never won a race? Well... not exactly... Not even finished?! ...Kitster's right, I will this time. Of course you will. Toogi! Toogie! Toong mee cha kulkah du Boonta magi! tah oos azalus ooval Poddraces. That's absolutly right. And a big turnout here, from all corners of the Outer Rim territories. I see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid. La Yma beestoo. I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund system. ...eh Gasgano doowa newpa Ord Petrovia! Two time winner, Boles Roor ... Poo tula moosta, woe grane champio Sebulba du Pixelito! Splastyleeya bookie ookie!! And a late entry, Anakin Skywalker, a local boy. Wampa peedunkee unko. I see the flaggers are moving onto the track. Peeusa! You won't walk away from this one, Skywalker. You slave scum. Don't count on it, slime-ball. You're bantha fodder! You all set, Ani? Yep. All right. Remember, concentrate on the moment. Feel. Don't think. Use your instincts. I will. May the Force be with you. O grandio lust amu intoe tah parena, Jabba Du Hutt. Welcome! Begin the race! Is he nervous? He's fine. You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen is not... The Queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden. You should too. You assume too much. Start your engines. Oh, dissen ganna be messy! Mesa no watchen. An dare ovv! Oh...wait. Little Skywalker has stalled. Well it looks like Quadrinaros is having engine trouble also. C'mon Ani! And there goes Skywalker... Go Ani, go! He'll be hard pressed to catch up with the leaders. Looks like a few Tusken Riaders have camped out on the canyon dune turn. Ooo! There goes Quadrinaros power cuppling. Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata! Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! Droids! Where is master Anakin? Look, here he comes! It looks like Skywalker is moving up in the field... He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear! Lap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The crowd stands and YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the distance. Oh, I don't care what universe you're from, that's gotta hurt. Here he comes, yahoo! At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely followed by Skywalker... Skywalker's been forced onto the service ramp! It's Skywalker! The crowd goes wild. Amazing... a quick controlled thrust and he's back on course! Did he crashed? Skywalker's in trouble. Sebulba takes the lead. He's catching Sebulba. Inkabunga. Careful, Ani, careful, Ani! That little human being is out of his mind. Punda tah punda! They're side by side! Bongo du bongu! Poodu! I can't believe it. The crowds are going nuts! Oh Ah Oh Ah. Mom! I did it! Yeah! Great job, Ani! We owe you everything, Ani. It's so wonderful, Ani. You have brought hope to those who have none. I'm so very proud of you... Ah... You! You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to win! Somehow you knew it! I lost everything. Whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you'll lose. Bring the parts to the main hanger. I'll come by your shop later so you can release the boy. You can't have him! It wasn't a fair bet! Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts ... I'm sure they can settle this. Take him! Well, we have all the essential parts we need. I'm going back...some unfinished business. I won't be long. Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life form...? It's the boy who's responsible for getting those parts. Get this hyperdrive generator installed. Yes, Master. It shouldn't take long. Hi! Yes! Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have! Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful Ani. And Anakin has been freed. What?!? You're no longer a slave. Did you hear that? Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! (turns to Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi? Yes. Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident. You mean I get to come with you in your starship?! Anakin, training to become a Jedi is not be a easy challenge. And if you succeed, it's a hard life. But I want to go. It's what I've always dreamed of doing. Can I go, Mom?! Anakin, this path has been placed for you; the choice is yours alone. I want to do it. Then, pack your things. We haven't much time. Yipee!! What about Mom? Is she free too? I tried to free your mother, Ani, but Watto wouldn't have it. You're coming, aren't you, Mom? Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let go... I don't want things to change. But you can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from setting. Now... hurry. Thank you. I'll watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right? Oh! Oh my, oh. Hello Master Anakin. Well, Threepio, I'm free... and I'm going away... in a starship... Master, Ani, you are my maker, and I wish you well. However, I should prefer it if I were a little more... comepleted. I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, Threepio ...give you coverings and all â€¦Iâ€™m going to miss working on you. You've been a great pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything. Sell me?!? Bye. I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it. Aniâ€¦ Will I ever see you again? What does your heart tell you? I hope so... yes... I guess. Then we will see each other again. I will come back and free you, Mom... I promise. Now be brave, and don't look back... don't look back. Qui-Gon, sir, wait, I'm tired! Anakin, drop! Ani, tell them to take off! Qui-Gon's in trouble! Take off. Over there! Fly low! Are you all right? I think so. What was it? I'm not sure... but he was well trained in the Jedi arts. My guess is he was after the Queen... What are we going to do about it? We will be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi. Hi. You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you. Your Queen is lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die, much sooner than your people, I'm afraid. This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people have decided... Take him away. My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these rumored underwater villages... they will not stay hidden for long. Are you all right? It's very cold. She goes over to him. He looks up at her with tears in his eyes. He is holding his arms to keep himself warm. You come from a warm planet, Annie. A little too warm for my taste. Space is cold. You seem sad. The Queen is... worried. Her people are suffering... dying. She must convince the Senate to intervene, I'm not sure what will happen. I made this for you. So you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will bring you good fortune. It's beautiful, but I don't need this to remember you by. Many things will change when we reach the capital, Ani. My caring for you will remain. I care for you too. Only I... ...Miss your mother. Coruscant... the entire planet is one big city. There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle. And look over there, Senator Palpatine is waiting for us. It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. With the communications breakdown, we've become very concerned. I'm anxious to hear your report on the situation. May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum. Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honor to finally meet you in person. Thank you, Supreme Chancellor. I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant situation. I've called for a special session of the Senate to hear your position. I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor. There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can overcome it... I must speak with the Jedi Council immediately. The situation has become more complicated. ...the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates. There is no interest in the common good. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the invasion. Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope. If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real power... he is mired by baseless accusations of corruption. The bureaucrats are in charge now. What options have we? Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum. He has been our strongest supporter? Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the courts... The courts take even longer to decide things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator... We must do something quickly to stop the Federation. To be realistic, Your Majesty, I think we're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being. That is something I cannot do. ...He was trained in the Jedi arts. My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord. Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium. I do not believe the Sith could have returned without us knowing. Ah, hard to see, the dark side is. We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and discover the identity of your attacker... May the Force be with you. Master Qui-Gon more to say have you? With your permission, my Master. I have encountered a vergence in the Force. A vergence, you say? Located around a person? A boy... his cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians I have ever seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians. You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring balance to the Force... you believe it's this boy? I don't presume... But you do! Revealed your opinion is. I request the boy be tested, Master. Trained as a Jedi, you request for him? Finding him was the will of the Force... I have no doubt of that. Bring him before us, then. The boy is here to see Padme. Let him in. I'm sorry, Ani, but Padme is not here right now. Who is it? Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness. I've sent Padme on an errand. I'm on my way to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope. I may not see her again... so... I came to say goodbye. We will tell her for you. We are sure her heart goes with you. Thank you, Your Highness. The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of Naboo. Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has occurred which started with the taxation of trade routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppression of the Trade Federation. This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements! The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade Federation at this time. Please return to your station. To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, recently elected ruler of Naboo, who speaks on our behalf. Honorable representatives of the Republic, I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. Naboo system has been invaded by the droid armies of the Trade... I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth. The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commission must be appointed. The point... Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will dissapear. The point is conceded ... will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations? I will not defer... I have come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed... I move for a vote of no confidence... in Chancellor Valorum's leadership. Vote now! Vote now! Vote now! Order! Now they will elect a new Chancellor, a strong Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue... The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master. He's too old. Anakin will become a Jedi ... I promise you. Do not defy the Council, Master... not again. I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan. If you would just follow the code you would be on the council. They will not go along with you this time. You still have much to learn, my young apprentice. A ship... a cup... a ship... a speeder. mm... how feel you? Cold, sir. fraid are you? No, sir. See through you, we can. Be mindful of your feelings... Your thoughts dwell on your mother. I miss her. Afraid to lose her... I think, hmm? What's that got to do with anything? Everything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering... I sense much fear in you. Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die? I don't know. Gungans get pasted too, eh? I hope not. Gungans no die'n without a fight... wesa warriors. Wesa gotta grand army. Dat why yousa no liken us, mesatinks. Your Highness? Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has been nominated to succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor. A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. Your Majesty, if I am elected, I promise put an end to corruption. Who else can be nominated? Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ailee Teem of Malastare. I feel confident... our situation will create a strong sympathy vote for us... I will be Chancellor. I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator, there will be nothing left of our our people, our way of life... I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet. Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I've decided to go back to Naboo. Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! They'll force you to sign the treaty. I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different from that of our people. Captain! Your Highness? Ready my ship! Please, Your Majesty, stay here... where it's safe. It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the Senate. The Force is strong with him. He's to be trained, then? No. He will not be trained. He is too old. He is the chosen one... you must see it. Clouded, this boy's future is. I will train him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner. An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second. The code forbids it. Obi-Wan is ready... I am ready to face the trials. Our own council we will keep on who is ready. He is headstrong and he has much to learn of the living Force, but he is capable. There is little more he can learn from me. Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later. Now is not the time for this... the Senate is voting for a new Supreme Chancellor and Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation. And draw out the Queen's attacker. Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith. May the Force be with you. It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth. From your point of view... The boy is dangerous... they all sense it. Why can't you? His fate is uncertain, he's not dangerous. The Council will decide Anakin's future... that should be enough for you. Now get on board! Master Qui-Gon, sir, I don't want to be a problem. You won't be, Ani... I'm not allowed to train you, so I want you to watch me and be mindful. ...always remember, your focus determines your reality. Stay close to me and you will be safe. Master, sir... I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians. I've been wondering, what are midi-chlorians? Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all living cells. They live inside of me? In your cells, yes... and we are symbionts with them. Symbionts? Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the Force. They continually speak to us, telling us the will of the Force. When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to you. I don't understand. With time and training, Ani... you will... you will. Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to continue to serve and protect you. I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears the Federation means to destroy me. I assure you, I will not let that happen. Wesa goen home! C'mon, Artoo. Is the planet secure? We have taken over the last pockets of primitive life forms. We are in complete control of the planet now. Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as they are. I'm sending my apprentice, Darth Maul, to join you. Yes, my Lord. A Sith Lord here?!! Those are the forward stabalizers. And those two control the pitch? You catch on pretty quick. As soon as we land the Federation will arrest you, and force you to sign the treaty. I agree... I'm not sure what you wish to accomplish by this. I will take back what's ours. There are too few of us, Your Highness.... we have no army. And I can only protect you. I cannot fight a war for you. Jar Jar Binks! Mesa, Your Highness? Yes. I need your help. I have one battleship on my scope. It's a droid control ship. They've probably spotted us. We haven't much time. Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master. Good. Do you think the Queen's idea will work? The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and we cannot use our power to help her. I'm... I'm sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place to disagree with you about the boy... and I am grateful you think I am ready to take the trials. You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan, and you're a much wiser man than I am. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight. Dare-sa nobody dare. Da Gungan city is diserted. Some kinda fight, mesa tinks. Do you think they have been taken to camps? More likely they were wiped out. Mesa no tink so. Do you know where they are, Jar Jar? When in trouble, Gungans go to sacred place. Mesa show you. C'mon, mesa show you. You Honor, Queen Amidala of the Naboo. Ah, ello dare, ye big Boss Nass, You Honor. Jar Jar Binks, who's da uss-en others?? I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo... I come before you in peace. Ah, Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks... Yousa all bombad. We have searched you out 'cause we wish to form an alliance... Your Honor... Whosa dis? I am Queen Amidala. This is my decoy... my protection... my loyal bodyguard. ...I am sorry for my deception, but it was necessary to protect myself. Although we do not always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived in peace. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build. If we do not act quickly, all will be lost forever... I ask you to help us... (PADME drops to her knees before the GUNGANS.)... no, I beg you to help us. We are your humble servants... ...Our fate is in your hands. Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis. Maybe wesa bein friends. ...we've sent out patrols. We've already located their starship in the swamp... It won't be long, My Lord. This is an unexpected move for her. It's too aggressive... Lord Maul, be mindful. Let them make the first move. Yes, my Master. Daza comen! All right... ...They're here. Good, they made it. Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen usen an da Naboo together. Oh, no, no, no... So, wesa make yous Bombad General. General??! Oh, no.. What is the situation? Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards have formed an underground resistance movement. I brought back as many of the leaders as I could. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win. The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the Droid Army away from the cities. (to Artoo) Artoo, we can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Panaka will create a diversion. Then we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy. Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused. What do you think, Master Jedi? The Viceroy will be well guarded. The difficulty's getting into the throne room. Once we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem. There is a possibility, with this diversion many, Gungans will be killed. Wesa ready to do are-sa part. We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship orbiting the planet. A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields. And there's an even bigger danger. If the Viceroy escapes, Your Highness, he will return with another droid army. Well that is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything depends on it. ...she is more foolish than I thought. We are sending more troops to meet this army assembling in the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives. This will work to our advantage. I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord. Wipe them out... all of them. Halt! Starten up the shield. Pull 'em forward. Once we get inside, you find a safe place to hide and stay there. Sure. Stay there! i thought the battle was going to take place far from here... this is too close! Ani, find cover, quick! Get to your ships! Fighters straight ahead. Roger, Brovo Leader. Roger, Brovo Leader. Cease fire! Steady, steady. Activate the droids. Yes, sir! Ouch time. Fire! My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room. Red Group, Blue Group, everybody, this way. Hey! Wait for me. Anakin, stay where you are. You'll be safe there. But, I... Stay in that cockpit. We'll handle this... We'll take the long way. We've gotta do something, Artoo! I'm trying to. I don't know where the trigger is. Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one.... No. Wait, here it is. Let's go! Ah... It's on automatic pilot. Try and override it. We don't have time for this, Captain. Look! There they are! That's where the autopilot is taking us. Their deflector shield is too strong. This is tense! Artoo, get us off this Autopilot! It's gonna get us both killed! You did it, Artoo! Okay, let's go left! Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and that's what I'm gonna do. Now the enemy ship is on his tail. He tries evasive maneuvers. I'll try spinning, that's a good trick. I know we're in trouble! Just hang on! Go! Dis is nuttsen. O, oh. Hey, hey! Gimme a lift. Ja Ja! Usen da booba! Wat! Mesa no have a booba. Here, taken dis one. Ja Ja! Jump Ja Ja! Jump! Throw down your weapons. They win this round. We're hit Artoo! Wah... I'm tring to stop. I'm tring to stop. Everything's overheated. Oops! This is not good. Noooo! No given up General Ja Ja. Wesa tink of sometin. Hands up! My giv up. My giv up. Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you to sign the treaty... and end this pointless debate in the Senate. Viceroy, your occupation here has ended! After her! This one is a decoy! Jam the doors! Now, Viceroy, we will discuss a new treaty. Yes! We have power. Shields up. Take this!... â€¦and this! Woa! Oops. Sir, we're losing power... There seems to be a problem with the main reactor... Impossible!! Nothing can get through our shield. Let's get out of here. What's that?? It's blowing up from the inside. We didn't hit it. Look! One of ours! Outta the main hold!! Whoo, hoo! Whatsen dey doin? The control ship has been destroyed. Look! Dey all broken. It is too late... It's... No! Obi-Wan promise ... promise me you'll train the boy... Yes, Master... He is the chosen one... he will... bring balance... train him! Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go back to the Senate and explain all this. I think you can kiss your Trade franchise goodbye. We are indebted to you for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi. And you, young Skywalker, we will watch your career with great interest. Congratulations on your election, Chancellor. Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty. It is you who should be congratulated. Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the Republic. Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Council does. But agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not. Qui-Gon believed in him. The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training. Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without the approval of the Council if I must. Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree with you, the council does. Your apprentice, Skywalker will be. What will happen to me now? The Council has granted me permission to train you. You will be a Jedi, I promise. There's no doubt. The mysterious warrior was a Sith. Always two there are... no more... no less. A master and an apprentice. But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice? Peace!",
            four: "Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going? The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner. Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe? Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic... Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan... You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her away! Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir. How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way. That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you! Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. Look, sir -- droids. Wake up! Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. I have no need for a protocol droid. Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators. You could say... Do you speak Bocce? Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me...I'm as fluent in... All right shut up! I'll take this one. Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner. But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters... You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it! All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go. Uncle Owen... Yeah?This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look! Hey, what're you trying to push on us? Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain. Uncle Owen... Yeah? What about that one? What about that blue one? We'll take that one. Yeah, take it away. Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. Okay, let's go. Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here! Is there anything I might do to help? Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on. Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. I see, sir. Uh, you can call me Luke. I see, sir Luke. Just Luke. And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo. Hello. You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action. With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all. You know of the Rebellion against the Empire? That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir. Have you been in many battles? Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways. Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or...  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. What's this? What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that? Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Who is she? She's beautiful. I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi... I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to... Is there more to this recording? Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master. He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing. He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message. What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! Luke? Luke! Come to dinner! All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either. You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers. Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year. You mean the next semester before harvest? Sure, there're more than enough droids. Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke. But it's a whole 'nother year. Look, it's only one more season. Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. Where are you going? It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids. Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. That's what I'm afraid of. What are you doing hiding there? It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning, kept babbling on about his mission. Oh, no! That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir. Luke? Luke? Luke? Have you seen Luke this morning? He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early. Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him? I think so. Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay! Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid...hit the accelerator. Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now. Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about? Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on the move. No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. You fought in the Clone Wars? Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father. I wish I'd known him. He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile. Sure, go ahead. What is it? Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire. How did my father die? A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. The Force? Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from. I saw part of the message he was... I seem to have found it. General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope. You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. That's your uncle talking. Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this? Learn about the Force, Luke. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You must do what you feel is right, of course. Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station! The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.... The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station. And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it! Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort... I find your lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this! Vader, release him! As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke. It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...I never heard of them hitting anything this big before. They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers. These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise. Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home! Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous. Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen! And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base. There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? About three or four seasons. They're for sale if you want them.  Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification. These are not the droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your business. Move along. Move along. Move along. I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures. Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead. The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally. Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough. I'm ready for anything. Come along, Artoo. We don't serve their kind here! What? Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. I heartily agree with you sir. Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn't like you. I'm sorry. I don't like you either You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems. I'll be careful than. You'll be dead. This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something... This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs. I don't like the look of this. Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo? Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. What is it? Some kind of local trouble? Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements. Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance. Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that! But who's going to fly it, kid! You? You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen... We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan. Seventeen, huh! Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four. Ninety-four. Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork. All right, we'll check it out. Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready. You'll have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba... Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser. Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice? You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. Over my dead body. That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time. Yes, I'll bet you have. Sorry about the mess. Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her. The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?  Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure. Lock the door, Artoo. All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next door. I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. You watch your language! He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand. It will be enough. If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well. What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel. It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins! How long before you can make the jump to light speed? It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer. Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining... Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? What's that flashing? We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed. We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready. What? You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. No! Commence primary ignition. Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You mean it controls your actions? Partially. But it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Stretch out with your feelings. You see, you can do it. I call it luck. In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else. Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan. You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world. Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately! Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts. What's going on? Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan! What do you mean? Where is it? Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed...by the Empire! The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. Not for long... A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in range. That's no moon! It's a space station. It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about this. Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! But there's gotta be something you can do! There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight! You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting. To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! Yes. We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned. Did you find any droids? No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked. Yes, sir. I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since... Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.  Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him? The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network. He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. But he can... They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you...always! Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil? Ben is a great man. Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. I didn't hear you give any ideas... Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up... Who do you think...  What is it? I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keeps repeating, She's here. Well, who...who has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She's here? Princess? What's going on? Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something. What are you talking about? The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've got to help her. Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block? I'm not going anywhere. They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. But they're going to kill her! Better her than me... She's rich. Rich? Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... What? Well more wealth that you can imagine. I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! You'll get it! I better! You will... All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this. All right. What's your plan? Uh...Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you. Okay. Han, you put these on. Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind. Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking...but, ah...what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here? Lock the door! And hope they don't have blasters. That isn't very reassuring. I can't see a thing in this helmet. This is not going to work. Why didn't you say so before? I did say so before! Where are you taking this...thing? Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight. I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. Look out! We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal. What happened? Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? We're sending a squad up. Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous.  Who is this? What's your operating number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company! Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? Come on!  He is here... Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Surely he must be dead by now. Don't underestimate the power of the Force. The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. Yes. Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty-three. The princess! Put all sections on alert! Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone. Chewie! Get behind me! Get behind me! Can't get out that way. Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. See-Threepio! See-Threepio! Yes sir?  We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that? I didn't copy! I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out, all other information on your level is restricted. Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't... What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there! Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there... No! wait! Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed! Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed. Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worst... It's worst. There's something alive in here! That's your imagination. Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? What? Help! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! Oh!! Luke! Luke! Grab him! What happened? I've got a very bad feeling about this. The walls are moving! Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something. Wait a minute! Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be? Take over! See to him! Look there! They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. Follow me! You stand guard. Come on! Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. All right. Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! Get to the top! I can't Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. Hurry! One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it! I'm trying! Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We've had some problems... Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great. Hey...hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? Three-two-six-eight-two-seven. If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here. Well, let's get moving! Where are you going? No, wait. They'll hear! Come here, you big coward! Chewie! Come here! Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay? Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me! It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this. Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports. Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another drill. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it. There she is. See-Threepio, do you copy? For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship. We're right above you. Stand by. You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought. Nice! Come on! It's them! Blast them! Get back to the ship! Where are you going? Come back! He certainly has courage. What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! I think we took a wrong turn. There's no lock! That oughta hold it for a while. Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge. Oh, I think I just blasted it. They're coming through! Here, hold this. Here they come! For luck! Where could they be? Close the blast doors! Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner, now I am the master. Only a master of evil, Darth. Your powers are weak, old man. You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid! Run, Luke! Run! I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! I can't believe he's gone. There wasn't anything you could have done. Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet! You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp! Here they come! They're coming in too fast! Oooh! We've lost lateral controls. Don't worry, she'll hold together. You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don't get cocky. There are still two more of them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting!  This is all your fault. Are they away? They have just made the jump into hyperspace. You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work. Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. Easy...you call that easy? Their tracking us! Not this ship, sister. At least the information in Artoo is still intact. What's so important? What's he carrying? The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet! It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money! You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive! Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No! You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet. The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. That's impossible, even for a computer. It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters. Man your ships! And may the Force be with you! Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion. All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations. So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then? That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you. Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them. What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? Hey, Luke...may the Force be with you! What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing. What's wrong? Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo? Okay, easy she goes! Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you. All wings report in. Red Ten standing by. Red Seven standing by. Red Three standing by. Red Six standing by. Red Nine standing by. Red Two standing by. Red Eleven standing by. Red Five standing by. Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through their magnetic field. Hold tight! Switch your deflectors on. Double front! Look at the size of that thing! Cut the chatter, Red Two. Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys! Red Leader, this is Gold Leader. I copy, Gold Leader. We're starting for the target shaft now. We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire. Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees. I see it. Stay low. This is Red Five, I'm going in! Luke, pull up! Are you all right? I got a little cooked, but I'm okay. We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers! We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke, let me know when you're going in. I'm on my way in now... Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way. My scope's negative. I don't see anything. Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up. Biggs! You've picked one up...watch it! I can't see it! Where is he?! He's on me tight, I can't shake him...I can't shake him. Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in. Got him! Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me! Pull in! Luke...pull in! Watch your back, Luke! Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in! I'm hit, but not bad. Artoo, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there. Red Six... Can you see Red Five? There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you? I can't shake him! I'm on him, Luke! Hold on! Blast it! Wedge where are you? Thanks, Wedge. Good shooting, Wedge! Red Leader... This is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run. I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. Stay in attack formation! The exhaust post is... marked and locked in! Switch power to front deflector screens. How many guns do you think, Gold Five. I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers. Death Star will be in range in five minutes. Switching to targeting computer. Computer's locked. Getting a signal. The guns...they've stopped! Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters. They've coming in! Three marks at two ten. I'll take them myself! Cover me! Yes, sir. I can't maneuver! Stay on target. We're too close. Stay on target! Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch. I copy, Gold Five. They came from behind.... We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances! Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red Group, this is Red Leader. Rendezvous at mark six point one. This is Red Two. Flying toward you. Red Three, standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal...to start your run. This is it! We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters! There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are? No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five. I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up! Just hold them off for a few seconds. Close up formation. You'd better let her loose. Almost there! I can't hold them! It's away! It's a hit! Negative. Negative! It didn't go in. It just impacted on the surface. Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to point... oh-five, we'll cover for you. Stay there... I just lost my starboard engine. Get set to make your attack run. Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! Sorry! Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them! Artoo, try and increase the power! Hurry up, Luke! Wait! I'm on the leader. Hang on, Artoo! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost Artoo! You may fire when ready. I have you now. What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always. Luke! Luke! Luke! Hey! Hey! I knew you'd come back! I just knew it! Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward. Hey, I knew there was more to you than money. Oh, no! Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! You can repair him, can't you? We'll get to work on him right away. You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them. He'll be all right.",
            five: "Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back. Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something? Aaargh! Chewie! All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand. Solo? No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.You'll know if anything comes around. Commander Skywalker reported in yet? No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships. General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.  A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you. Thank you, General. Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That's right. Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay. Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Han, we need you! We? Yes. Oh, what about you need? I need? I don't know what you're talking about. You probably don't. And what precisely am I supposed to know?  Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader... No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on. You're imagining things. Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss? I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss! Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know. Oh, switch off. Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these. Excuse me, sir. Put them back together right now. Might I have a word with you, please? What do you want? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.  Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is. I don't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. What do you mean, nobody knows? Well, uh, you see... Deck Officer. Deck Officer! Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-... Yes, sir? Do you know where Commander Skywalker is? I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance. It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on? Why not? Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger. Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in. Not likely. Are the speeders ready? Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold. Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns. Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly. That's right. And my friends out in it. I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha. Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker. Then I'll see you in hell! You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up. Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right. Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo. Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope. Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed. Close the doors. Yes, sir. Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one. Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being. Luke...Luke. Ben? You will go to the Dagobah system. Dagobah system? There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me. Ben...Ben. Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. Not much time. Ben...Ben... Hang on, kid. Dagobah system... Whew... Dagobah... This may smell bad, kid... Yoda... but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built. Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside! Echo Base...I've got something! Not much, but it could be a life form. This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two. Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by. Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found them. Repeat, I found them. Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again. Artoo expresses his relief, also. How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark. Thanks to you. That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield. That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight. I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain. Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage. She expressed her true feelings for me. My...! Why, you stuck up...half-witted...scruffy-looking...nerf-herder! Who's scruffy-looking? I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid? Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet? Headquarters personnel, report to command center. Take it easy. Excuse us, please. Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. It's metal. Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke. It could be a speeder, one of ours. No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code. It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out. Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight. Afraid there's not much left. What was it? Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct. An Imperial probe droid. It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here. We'd better start the evacuation. Admiral. Yes, Captain I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had. We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads! The visuals indicate life readings. It could mean anything. If we followed every lead... But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms. You found something? Yes, my lord. That's it. The Rebels are there. My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be... hat is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men. Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch. Right, sir. Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off! Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-sevens. Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. Take care, sir. Thanks. Chewie, take care of yourself, okay? Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right? Yeah. Be careful. You, too.Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault. What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser... He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord. Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh! You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett. Yes, my lord. Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader. All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports. Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?  The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood? Right. Okay. Good luck. Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go! Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield. Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector. Good. Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control....Fire! The first transport is away. Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dack. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station Three-T-Eight. We have spotted Imperial walkers! Imperial walkers on the north ridge. Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.  All right, boys, keep tight now. Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now! All right, I'm coming in. Hobbie, you still with me? That armor's too strong for blasters. Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack. Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary. ust hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable. Dack? Dack! Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing. Rouge Three. Copy, Rouge Leader Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass. oming around, Rouge Leader. Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear. All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator. Rouge Two, are you all right? Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader. We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you. Coming around. Watch that cross fire, boys. Set for position three. Steady. Stay tight and low. Hobbie, I've been hit! You all right? Why are you still here? I heard the command center had been hit. You got your clearance to leave. Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship. Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope. Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters. Imperial troops have entered the base. Come on...that's it. Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports! K-one-zero...all troops disengage.  Oh! Wait for me! Begin retreat! Fall back! Distance to power generators? One-seven, decimal two-eight. Target. Maximum fire power. Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon. But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!! Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical. Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident! Wait! Wait! How's this? Would it helped if I got out and pushed? It might. Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait. he bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade. This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.  Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout. See? Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it. Punch it! Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff. Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous. Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going. There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course. We're not going to regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system. Yes, Artoo? That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while. I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... shut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them. Prepare to make the jump to light-speed. But, sir! They're getting closer! Oh yeah? Watch this. Watch what? I think we're in trouble. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble! Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners! I don't know how we're going to get out of this one. Oww! Chewie! That was no laser blast! Something hit us. Han, get up here! Come on, Chewie! Asteroids! Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one. What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field? They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they? You don't have to do this to impress me. Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one. Never tell me the odds! You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. well, this could be it, sweetheart. I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. I'm not going to argue with that. Pulverized? I'm going in closer to one of the big ones. Closer? Closer?! h, this is suicide! There. That looks pretty good. What looks pretty good? Yeah. That'll do nicely. Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? I hope you know what you're doing. Yeah, me too. Yes, that's it. Dagobah. No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there... Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids. I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle... No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around. Artoo? Artoo! Where are you? Artoo! You be more careful. Artoo - that way! Artoo! Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken? If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy. Yes, Admiral? Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk... Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses. Yes, lord. I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems. Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too? o, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive. Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive. Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most... Let go. Sshh! et go, please. Don't get excited. Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited. Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else. Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go. Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists. Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know... Like we're being watched! Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm. I am wondering, why are you here? I'm looking for someone. Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm? Right. Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.  don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior. Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not make one great. But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not.  don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah! Oh, Artoo, let him have it. Mine! Mine! Artoo! Mine! Mine! Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do. No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend, hmm? I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master. Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda. You know him? Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come. Come, come. Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo. Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it. Well, of course I'll have to replace it. Here! And Chewie... ...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling. Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that. Stop that. Stop what? Stop that! My hands are dirty. My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of? Afraid? You're trembling. I'm not trembling. You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life. I happen to like nice men. I'm a nice man. No, you're not. You're... Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir. ...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed. No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found. Lord Vader. Yes, Admiral, what is it? The Emperor commands you make contact with him. Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission. Yes, my lord. What is thy bidding, my master? There is a great disturbance in the Force. I have felt it. We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker. Yes, my master. He could destroy us. He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, my master. Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now. Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm? How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there? Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm? Mostly because of my father, I guess. Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.  Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. He will learn patience. Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father. Was I any different when you taught me? Hah. He is not ready. Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready. Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!  So was I, if you'll remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. Will he finished what he begins? I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. Oh, you will be. You will be. Sir, if I may venture an opinion... I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio. There's something out there. Where? Outside, in the cave. There it is. Listen! Listen! I'm going out there. Are you crazy?! I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart. Then I'm going with you. I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no. This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all. There's an awful lot of moisture in here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. Watch out! Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables. Mynocks? Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more. Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo! Wait a minute... All right, Chewie, let's get out of here! The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to... No time to discuss this as a committee. I am not a committee! You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field... Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off! Look! I see it, I see it. We're doomed! The cave is collapsing. This is no cave. What? Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice. Vader. Is the dark side stronger? No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. But how am I to know the good side from the bad? You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. But tell me why I can't... No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm. There's something not right here. I feel cold, death. That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go. What's in there? Only what you take with you. our weapons...you will not need them. Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum. Those Rebels won't escape us. Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger. Right. ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations. As you wish. Lord Vader! My lord, we have them.  Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three! It's not fair! The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault! No light-speed? It's not my fault. Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. Turn her around. I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield. You're going to attack them?! Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer... Shut up! They're moving to attack position. Shields up! Track them. They may come around for another pass. Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. hey can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device. Well, there's no trace of them, sir. Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit. Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area. Yes, Captain Needa. Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate! Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. All right, I'll give it a try. No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try. I can't. It's too big. Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ..not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship! You want the impossible. I don't...I don't believe it. That is why you fail. Apology accepted, Captain Needa. Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now. Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory. Yes, my lord. We'll find them. Don't fail me again, Admiral. Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet. Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw. I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough... Thank you. What did you have in mind for your next move? Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas? No. Where are we? The Anoat system. Anoat system. There's not much there. No.  Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando. Lando system? Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him. Thanks. Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them. Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone. Han! Leia!  Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control. I saw...I saw a city in the clouds. Mmm. Friends you have there. They were in pain. It is the future you see. Future? Will they die? Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future. I've got to go to them. Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered. No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian. Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain. You will not deviate from your present course. Rather touchy, aren't they? I thought you knew this person. Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that. Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven. Thank you. There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me. Who's worried? Oh. No one to meet us. I don't like this. Well, what would you like? Well, they did let us land. Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me. See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay? Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled. How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! Inever thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been? Well, he seems very friendly. Yes...very friendly. What are you doing here? Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out. What have you done to my ship? Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square. Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be? Leia. Welcome, Leia. All right, all right, you old smoothie. Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good.  You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful. Oh! Nice to see a familiar face. E chu ta! ow rude! That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if... Hello? How interesting. Oh, my. Who are you? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No! Luke! You must complete the training. I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them. You must not go! But Han and Leia will die if I don't. You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate. But I can help them! I feel the Force! But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force. Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave! But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word. It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer. And that is why I have to go. Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader. You won't. Stopped they must be. On this depends.  Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil. Patience. And sacrifice Han and Leia? If you honor what they fight for...yes! If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere. I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters. Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side. Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can. I will. And I'll return. I promise. Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse. That boy is our last hope. No. There is another. The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape. The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost. Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out. I don't trust Lando. Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone. And then you're as good as gone, aren't you? What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why? So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down? That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever. We would be honored if you would join us. I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. No, Threepio's with them. Just hang on. We're almost there. Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No! Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot! Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time. Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough... I feel terrible. Why are they doing this? They never even asked me any questions. Lando. Get out of here, Lando! Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. Over to you? They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. What about Han? Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.  Vader wants us all dead. He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker. Luke? Lord Vader has set a trap for him. And we're the bait. Well, he's on his way. Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?  My friend! Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems. Yeah, you're a real hero. You certainly have a way with people. This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor. Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class. Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land. Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him. I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on Captain Solo. If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish. What's going on...buddy? You're being put into carbon freeze. What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me. The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in! Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...! Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop! Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die. Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey! Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me? I love you! I know. What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is. Well, Calrissian, did he survive? Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation. He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker. Skywalker has just landed, my lord. Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship. You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision. I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further. Luke! Luke, don't - it's a trap! It's a trap! The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet. Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move. What do you think you're doing? We're getting out of here. I knew all along it had to be a mistake. Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you? I had no choice... What are you doing? Trust him, trust him! Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice. I'm just trying to help... We don't need any of your help. H-a-a-a... What? It sounds like Han. There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform... Chewie. I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee. Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold. Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been? Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me! Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you! You have learned much, young one. You'll find I'm full of surprises. Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true. No! All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. Impressive...most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me. The security codes has been changed! Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way. Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump. I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful! Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow! Leia! Go! I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better. You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did. There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.  I'll never join you! If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way. Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is. But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right. Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie. Let's go. I'll be back. Star Destroyer. All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed. If your people fixed the hyperdrive. All the coordinates are set. It's now or never. Punch it! They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault! They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord. Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon? Yes, my lord. Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun. Yes, my lord. Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing! Luke. Father. Son, come with me. Ben, why didn't you tell me? Chewie! It's Vader. Luke...it is your destiny. Ben, why didn't you tell me? Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! Oh, you did it! Luke, we're ready for takeoff. Good luck, Lando When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you. I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine. Princess, we'll find Han. I promise. Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal. Take care, you two. May the Force be with you. Ow!",
            six: "Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield. The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed. We're starting our approach. Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived. Yes, sir. Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.  The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.  Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. Artoo whistles timidly. Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit. Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose. There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.  Tee chuta hhat yudd! Goodness gracious me! Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt. I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me! Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.  Die Wanna Wanga! Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt...and a gift. Gift, what gift? Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Nudd Chaa. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. Bo Shuda! The message, Artoo, the message. Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well.  This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message. There will be no bargain. We're doomed. I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is. Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite. What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!  Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not? I am See-Threepio, human-cy... Yes or no will do. Oh. Well, yes. How many languages do you speak? I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him. Disintegrated? Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber. Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh! You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely.  Da Eitha! Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota... Boscka! I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee. Oh, no! Chewbacca! At last we have the mighty Chewbacca. Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. I want fifty thousand. No less. Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator. This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. Zeebuss. He agrees! Just relax for a moment.  You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. I can't see. Your eyesight will return in time. Where am I? Jabba's palace. Who are you? Someone who loves you. Leia! I gotta get you out of here. What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault. It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder. Look... Take him away! Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool! Bring her to me. We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this... I'm sure. Ugh! Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me. Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him. I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor! Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage. Han! Luke! Are you all right? Fine. Together again, huh? Wouldn't miss it. How are we doing? The same as always. That bad, huh? Where's Leia? I'm here. Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. Good, I hate long waits. You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. Doesn't sound so bad. In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years. On second thought, let's pass on that, huh? You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.  I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. Oh... great! Soon you will learn to appreciate me. Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! Hmm. I wish I had your confidence. Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas. Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right? Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die. Move him into position. Put him in. Easy, Chewie. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! Hold it! Whoa! Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up! Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Get the gun! Point it at the deck! Point it at the deck! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Come on! Let's go! And don't forget the droids. We're on our way. I'll meet you back at the fleet. Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. I will. Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend. Rise, my friend. The Death Star will be completed on schedule. You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. Yes, my Master. Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. As you wish. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen. Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.  Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry. Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker. I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. Yoda will always be with you. Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view! Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.  Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born.  The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. Leia! Leia's my sister. Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor. Well, look at you, a general, huh? Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack. I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come. The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please. You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack Good luck. You're gonna need it. General Madine. We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator. Sounds dangerous. I wonder who they found to pull that off. General Solo, is your strike team assembled? Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. Rawwwrr! Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one. Uh, General... count me in. I'm with you, too! What is it? Ask me again sometime. Luke. Hi, Han... Chewie. Exciting is hardly the word I would use. Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. Look, would you get going, you pirate. Good luck. You, too. You got her warmed? Yeah, she's comin' up. No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie. Hey, are you awake? Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again. Come on, General, let's move. Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody? All set. Here we go again. All right, hang on. What is thy bidding, my Master? Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust? It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders. Yes, my Master. If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie. We have you on our screen now. Please identify. Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield. Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. Transmission commencing. Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. It'll work. It'll work. Vader's on that ship. Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. I don't know. Fly casual. I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here. Where is that shuttle going? Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination? Parts and technical crew for the forest moon. Do they have a code clearance? It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. Shall I hold them? No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself. As you wish, my lord. Carry on. They're not goin' for it, Chewie. Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course. Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem. Oh, I told you it was dangerous here. Shall we try and go around? It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us. Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here. Quietly, there might be more of them out there. Hey... it's me. Go for help! Go! Great. Come on. Over there! Two more of them! I see them. Wait, Leia! Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch! Hey, wait! Ahhh! Move closer! Get alongside that one! Get him! Keep on that one! I'll take these two! Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Luke! Where's Leia? What? She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh! Cut it out! I'm not gonna hurt you. Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. All right. You want something to eat? That's right. Come on. Hmmm? Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? What is it? Freeze! Come on, get up! Go get your ride and take her back to base. Yes, sir. Come on, let's get outta here. I told you to remain on the command ship. A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. Yes, I know. My son is with them. Are you sure? I have felt him, my Master. Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. They are clear, my Master. Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. He will come to me? I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you andthen you will bring him before me. As you wish. Luke! Luke! Oh, Master Luke. I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia. I hope she's alright. What, Chewie? What? Chewie! Hey, I don't get it. Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie. Chewie, wa-wait! Don't!  Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Yeah, sure. Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!! Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else. Hey! Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow. Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness! Do you understand anything they're saying? Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. What are you telling them? Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god. Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this? I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. Proper?! It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Why, you-- My mistake. He's an old friend of mine. I have a really bad feeling about this. What did he say? I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. Leia! Oh! Your Royal Highness. But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free. Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly -- Just tell them. You see, Master Luke they didn't believe me. Just as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. Thanks, Threepio. I...I never knew I had it in me. Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. What's going on? I don't know. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. Thank you. Okay. He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day. Luke, what's wrong? Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just...images, really. Feelings. Tell me. She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? Vader is here...now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him. Why? He's my father. Your father? There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance. Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have. You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it... I have it ...and...my sister has it. Yes. It's you Leia. I know. Somehow...I've always known. Then you know why I have to face him. No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But, why must you confront him? Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. Hey, what's goin' on? Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on? I...I can't tell you. Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahhh... I'm sorry. Hold me. This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this. Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me. Yes, my Lord. The Emperor has been expecting you. I know, father. So, you have accepted the truth. I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. That name no longer has any meaning for me. It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master. I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny. Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead. The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy. Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. What's he saying? He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge. Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. All right. Stand by. Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him! Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. I have decided that we shall stay here. Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master. You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father. Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. His lightsaber. Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me. Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. It is pointless to resist, my son. Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive. All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. Charges! Come on, come on! Oh, my! They'll be captured! Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. Freeze! You Rebel scum.  All wings report in. Red Leader standing by. Gray Leader standing by. Green Leader standing by. Lock S-foils in attack positions. May the Force be with us. We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no reading. Are you sure? Pull up! All craft pull up! Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47. It's a trap! Fighters coming in. There's too many of them! Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader. Come, boy. See for yourself. From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion. You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant. No! It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine! All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here! Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back! Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above! Red Three, Red Two, pull in! Got it! Three of them coming in, twenty degrees! Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate. Pressure's steady. Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for. We're in attack position now, sir. Hold here. We're not going to attack? I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping. As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire! That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time. We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you. Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point-blank range. At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. She's gonna blow! I'm hit! Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete. Look! Get him off of there! I think I got it. I got it! Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? Let's see. It's not bad. Freeze! Oh, dear. Don't move! I love you. I know. Hands up! Stand up! Stay back. Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea. Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you. Obi-Wan has taught you well. I will not fight you, father. You are unwise to lower your defenses. Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. There is no conflict. You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. Good. Good. Watch out. Squad at .06. I'm on it, Gold Leader. Good shot, Red Two. Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down. It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. Open the back door. Yes, sir. Throw me another charge. You cannot hide forever, Luke. I will not fight you. Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. So be it...Jedi. Move! Move! The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it! If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision. Father, please. Help me. Now, young Skywalker...you will die. I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. Copy, Gold Leader. That was too close. We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer. Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. Intensify forward firepower! It's too late! Luke, help me take this mask off. But you'll die. Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. Now...go, my son. Leave me. No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. Father...I won't leave you. There it is! All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. Move the fleet away from the Death Star. They did it! I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew. He wasn't. I can feel it. You love him, don't you? Yes. All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way. No, it's not like that at all. He's my brother.",

              "This will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far, and seen too much, to ignore the despair in the galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force. Well, because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time. The General. To me, she's royalty. Well, she certainly is that. We've got company. You have to hide. You have to leave. Go! Come on, BB-8! Hurry! I see 'em! You take this. It's safer with you than it is with me. You get as far away from here as you can. Do you hear me? I'll come back for you! It will be alright. Stay here. Look how old you've become. Something far worse has happened to you. You know what I've come for. I know where you come from. Before you called yourself Kylo Ren. The map to Skywalker. We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order. The First Order rose from the dark side... you did not. I'll show you the dark side. You may try, but you cannot deny the truth that is your family. You're so right. So who talks first? You talk first? The old man gave it to you. It's just very hard to understand you with all the... Search him. Apparatus. Nothing, sir. Put him on board. Sir, the villagers. Kill them all. On my command! Fire! Nothing here. Go ahead! All right. All right! FN-2187. Submit your blaster for inspection. Yes, Captain. And who gave you permission to remove that helmet? I'm sorry, Captain. Report to my division at once. What you've brought me today is worth... Hmmm... One quarter portion. Tal'ama parqual! Parqual zatana! Shhhh. That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts. He has no respect for anyone. Your antenna's bent. Where do you come from? Classified. Really? Me too. Big secret. Niima Outpost is that way, stay off Kelvin Ridge. Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north, you'll drown in the sand. Don't follow me. Town is that way. No! In the morning, you go. You're welcome. I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. Comfortable? Not really. I'm impressed. No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map. Might wanna rethink your technique. Where is it? The Resistance will not be intimidated by you. Where... is it? It's in a droid. A BB unit. Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it. I leave that to you. Don't give up. He still might show up. Whoever it is you're waiting for. Classified. I know all about waiting. For my family. They'll be back. One day. Come on. These five pieces are worth... Let me see here... One half portion. Last week they were a half portion each. What about the droid? What about him? I'll pay for him. Sixty portions. Actually... the droid's not for sale. Come on. Follow the girl and get that droid. Ren wants the prisoner. Turn here. Listen carefully: you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here. If -- what--? This is a rescue, I'm helping you escape. Can you fly a TIE fighter? You with the Resistance--?! What? No no no! I'm breaking you out. Can you fly a TIE fighter? I can fly anything. Why, why are you helping me? Because it's the right thing to do. You need a pilot. I need a pilot. We're gonna do this. ... Yeah? Okay, stay calm, stay calm. I am calm. I'm talking to myself. Not yet. Okay, go. This way. I always wanted to fly one of these things. Can ya shoot? Blasters, I can! Okay, same principal! Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons, and mag pulse -- use the site on the right to aim, triggers to fire! This is very complicated I can fix this. I got it! Woooahhh! This thing really moves. All right, we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far! All right! I'm gonna get us in position, just stay sharp! Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it? I've got us dead centered. It's a clean shot. Okay, got it. YES! You see that?! DID YOU SEE THAT? I saw it! Hey, what's your name? FN-2187! FN-whaa? That's the only name they ever gave me! Well I ain't using it! FN, huh? Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn! That all right? Finn. Yeah, Finn, I like that! I like that! I'm Poe. Poe Dameron. Good to meet you, Poe! Good to meet you too, Finn! Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers-- Use the ventral cannons. Yes, sir. Bringing them online -- General Hux. Is it the Resistance pilot? Yes, and he had help. From one of our own. We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was. ... The one from the village. FN-2187. Sir. Ventral cannons hot. Fire. One's coming towards you. My right, your left. Do you see it? Hold on! I see it! Nice shot. Where are you going? We're going back to Jakku. That's where. No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! I got to get to my droid before the First Order does! What - a droid?! That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange and white: one of a kind. I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important! This one is, pal. We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die! That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker! Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I-- FN-2187 reported to my division, was evaluated and sent to Reconditioning. No prior signs of non-conformity? This was his first offense. General. They've been hit. Destroyed? Disabled. They were headed back to Jakku -- the fighter's projected to crash in the Goazon badlands. They were going back for the droid -- send a squad to the wreckage. Poe! Poe! Poe!!! POE! POE!!! POE!!! Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must. How capable are your soldiers, General? I won't have you question my methods. They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army. My men are exceptionally trained -- programmed from birth-- Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. Unharmed. Careful, Ren. That your personal interests not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke. I want that map. For your sake, I suggest you get it. Water... water... water.. -- Awgh, GAH! Who? Him? What's your hurry, thief? What--?! Thief? OW! HEY! What?! The jacket! This droid says you stole it! I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! STOP IT! Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master. It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right? He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed. Poe didn't make it. Look, I tried to help him. I'm sorry... So you're with the Resistance? Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah. I'm with the Resistance. I've never met a Resistance fighter before. Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different. BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base. Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it. Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth. What is it? What are you doing?! Come on! Come on, BB-8! Let go of me! No, we gotta move! I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way! Call in the air strike! They're shooting at both of us! Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked! Well, thanks for that! I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?! Are you okay? Stop taking my hand! Hey! -- Are you okay? Yeah. Follow me. We can't outrun them! We might in that quad-jumper! We need a pilot! We've got one! You?! What about that ship? That one's garbage! The garbage'll do! Gunner position's down there! Y'ever fly this thing? No! This ship hasn't been flown in years! Great. Whoa! I can do this, I can do this-- I can do this, I can do this-- HEY!!!! THAT'S MIIIIIIINE!!! Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low! WHAT? Stay low! It confuses their tracking! BB-8, hold on! I'M GOING LOW!!! What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?! I'm working on it! Are the shields up? Not so easy without a co-pilot! Try sitting in this thing! We need cover, quick! We're about to get some! I hope. Damn it! Come on... come on... Nice shot! I'm getting pretty good at this! The cannon's stuck in forward position, I can't move it! You gotta lose 'em! Get ready! Okay! For what? ARE WE REALLY DOING THIS?! Oh no! Whooo! Good shooting! Thanks! I-- Now that was some I don't know! -- I've flying! How did you flown some ships but I've do that?! No one never left the planet! trained you? No one? Your last shot was dead That was amazing! on. You got him with one blast! You set me up for it! It was perfect! That was pretty good. You're ok. He's with the Resistance. He's going to get you home. We both will. I don't know your name. Finn. What's yours. I'm Rey. Rey... Help me with this! Quick! Whoa! What's going on? Sir. We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. It escaped capture aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter. The droid... stole a freighter? Not exactly, sir. It had help. We have no confirmation, but we believe FN-2187 may have been helped in the escape-- Anything else? The two were accompanied by a girl. What girl? It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there! How bad is it?! If we wanna live, not good! They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is 'need to know' -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know! This? You gotta tell us where the base is. I don't speak that. Alright, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay? Droid, please. Pilex driver, hurry! So where's your base? Go on BB-8, tell her. Please! The Ileenium system? Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can. I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry! What about you? I gotta get back to Jakku! BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! This? Yes! Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? None of your business, THAT'S WHY! ...That can't be good. -- No it can't be -- Someone's locked onto us -- all controls are overridden. Get off. Get off! See anything? ...Oh no. It's the First Order. What do we do-- there must be SOMETHING -- You said poisonous gas -- -- Yeah, but I fixed that -- Can you unfix it? C'mon BB-8. I got it. Oooh... I'm okay. BB-8 get off me... You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers? Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins. Hurry! I'm hurrying! Chewie, we're home. Where are the others? Where's the pilot? ...I'm the pilot... You? No, it's true: we're the only ones on board. You can understand that thing? And 'that thing can understand you too, so watch it. Come on outta there. Where'd you get this ship? Niima Outpost. Jakku?! That junkyard? Thank you! Junkyard! Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches! Who had it, Ducain? I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain. Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good. This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo? I used to be. Han Solo? The Rebellion General? No, the smuggler! Wasn't he a war hero?! This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...! Twelve! Fourteen. Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line! Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on THE HYPERDRIVE-- -- Stress on the hyperdrive-- Wait! No -- we need your help! My help? This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible! He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him. Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke. Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten LOOSE-- Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey! You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you? I'm hauling Rathtars. Oh great. It's the Guavian Death Gang -- they must've tracked us from Nantoon. What's a Rathtar? They're big and dangerous... Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?! No. Good. I got three of 'em going to King Prana. THREE?! How'd you get them on board? I used to have a bigger crew. Get below deck and stay there until I say so -- don't even think about taking the Falcon. What about BB-8? He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way. What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them? There's one. What are you gonna do? Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it. Yes, I do. Every time. Han Solo. You are a dead man. Bala-Tik. What's the problem? The problem is we loaned you fifty thousand for this job. Can you see them? No. I heard you also borrowed fifty thousand from Kanjiklub. You know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each other? They have blasters... A lot of 'em. The question is how much longer will we know each other? Not long. We want our money back now. Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money. Kanjiklub wants their investment back, too. I never made a deal with Kanjiklub! Tell that to Kanjiklub. Tasu Leech. Good to see you. Wrong again, Solo. It's over for you. Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before? Yeah. Twice! What was the second time? Your game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle. Nowhere left for you to hide. That BB unit... the First Order is looking for one just like it. And two fugitives. First I've heard of it. Search the freighter. Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs! Close the blast doors from here? Resetting the fuses should do it. ... I got a bad feeling about this... Oh no. Oh no, what? Wrong fuses. Kill them! And take the droid! This was a mistake! Huge! What do they look like? They look like that. This way! Are you sure? FINN! REY! FINN!!!! Finn! It had me! But the door--! That was lucky! I got the door. Cover us! Chewie! You okay? Wow. Come on! Come on! Han! You, close the door behind us! You take care of Chewie! Hey, where are you going? Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too -- if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere. I hate that guy. And you could use a co-pilot. I got one, he's back there. Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed -- From inside the hangar? Is that even possible? I never ask that question until after I've done it. This is not how I thought this day was gonna go -- angle the shields -- Hang on back there! No problem! Come on baby, don't let me down! What?! Compressor. Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they want. And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon. The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance... ... Leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise. Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th-- General! Our strategy must now change. The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. Go. Oversee preparations. Yes, Supreme Leader. There's been an awakening. Have you felt it? Yes. There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo. Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise. He means nothing to me. Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test. By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced. We shall see. We shall see. Electrical overload! I can fix that! The coolant's leaking! Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank-- -- Secondary tank, I got it! Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie! You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me! Hurt him?! He almost killed me six times! This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems. What'd you do? I by-passed the compressor. Move, Ball. Nah, don't say that, you did great. Just rest. Good job, kid. And thanks. You're welcome. So, fugitives, huh? The First Order wants the map. Finn is with the Resistance... ... I'm just a scavenger. Let's see whatcha got. Go ahead. This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him. Why'd he leave? He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible... He walked away from everything. Do you know what happened to him? There're a lot of rumors. Stories. The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple. The Jedi were real? I used to wonder that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo -- magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light. 'Crazy thing is, it's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true. No, you rest. You want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop. ... I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy... Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here -- D'you just call me Solo? Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers? Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Always. You might need this. I think I can handle myself. I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. You know how to use one of these? Yeah, you pull the trigger. There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name? Rey. Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon. Are you offering me a job? I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much. You're offering me a job. I'm thinking about it. Well? If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home. Jakku? Yeah, Jakku. I've already been away too long. Chewie, check out the ship as best you can. It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you. Solo, why are we here again? To get your droid on a clean ship. Clean? Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet. We can trust her, right? Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare... At what? Any of it. Han Solo! Oh boy. Hey, Maz! Where's my boyfriend? Chewie's working on the Falcon. I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something. Desperately. Let's get to it. Alert the Resistance. Their missing droid is here! Inform the First Order... I've found the droid. Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me, Grandfather, and I will finish what you started. A map to Skywalker himself? You're right back in the mess. Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia. Hmm. No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han, nyakee nago wadda. Go home! Leia doesn't want to see me. Please, we came here for your help. What fight? The only fight: against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us. There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right-- What's this? What are you doing? Solo, what is she doing? I don't know, but it ain't good. If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run. You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen. You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run. You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear. Finn sees them. Considers. Finn! Come with me. What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base. I can't. Keep it, kid. Who's the girl? I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim. What are you doing? Don't leave without me. You can't just go. I won't let you. I'm not who you think I am. Finn, what are you talking about? I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper. Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing... But my first battle, I made a choice. I wasn't going to kill for them. So I ran. Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me. Don't go. Take care of yourself. Please. NO! No, come back! Quiet, girl! What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there. MAZ That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him and now, it calls to you! I have to get back to Jakku. Han told me. Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could. Luke. The belonging you seek is not behind you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi, but I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes. Feel it. The light. It's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it. I'm never touching that again. I don't want any part of this. Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand, will bring an end to the Senate! To their cherished fleet! All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this... as the last day of the Republic! FIRE! It was the Republic. The First Order, they've done it. Where's Rey? What are you doing? You have to go back. BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. They'll help you. I've had this for ages... Kept it locked away. Where'd you get that? A good question for another time. Take it! Find your friend! Those beasts! They're here! FN-417, hold position! Safety! Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl. You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off. I hope so, too. Come on, Chewie! Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now go. I need a weapon. You have one! Hey, can I try that? Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers and sends them flying. I like this thing. Traitor! You okay, Big deal? Thanks! Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody! We have incoming at two-eight-point- six! Move! Dispatch! Move! Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble all squads! Anti-air cover en route to our position! It's the Resistance. Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you! Copy that! We're with you, Poe! Quick! Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot! WOOHOO! The girl I've heard so much about. The droid. Where is it? Request air support! The map. You've seen it. Sir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops. Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need. Pull back the tree line! NO!! REY!!! No, no, no, no... REY!! He took her! Did you see that? He took her. She's gone! Yeah, yeah, I know... Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See- Threepio! You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. Look who it is! Did you see who? Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General. Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly. Yes, I must get my proper arm reinstalled. You changed your hair. Same jacket. No, new jacket. ...I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here. This is D'QAR. Poe. Poe Dameron. You're alive! So are you! What happened to you? What happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing-- BB-8 says that you saved him. No, no, no. It wasn't just me. You completed my mission, Finn. That's my jacket? Oh here. No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn. Poe -- I need your help. General Organa. Sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk to YOU -- And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life -- Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner-- Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry. Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base. We're desperate for anything you can tell us. That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast. And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know. That sounds very scary. You must be so brave. General, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse, it matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke. I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home. Leia... Don't do that. Do what? Anything. Princesses. I'm trying to be helpful! When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star. BB-8. You're wasting your time. It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data. I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly, he may never be his old self again. Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him. You think I want to forget him? I want him back! There was nothing we could've done. There was too much Vader in him. That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both. We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever good at. We both did. We lost our son, forever. No. It was Snoke. He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You. If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I? Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. There's still light in him. I know it. General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming. Where am I? You're my guest. Where are the others? You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea. Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious. You still want to kill me. That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask. Tell me about the droid. He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator -- He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece. And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger -- You know I can take whatever I want. ...You're so lonely ...so afraid to leave... At night, desperate to sleep... you imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see the island... And Han Solo. You feel like he's the father you never had. He would've disappointed you. -- Get out of my head -- I know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too. I'm not giving you anything. We'll see. ... You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader! This scavenger, resisted you? She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. And the droid? Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us. That the girl was all we needed. As a result, the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. They may have the map already. Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker. We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system. Good. Then we will crush them once and for all. Prepare the weapon. Supreme Leader. I can get the map from the girl. I just need your guidance. If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me. You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. What did you say? You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum! You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. I will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. And you will drop your weapon. And I'll drop my weapon. NO! Begin charging the weapon! Yes, sir. Weapon charging. The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report. They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself. A laser cannon? We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale. It's another Death Star. I wish that were the case, Major. This was the Death Star. This is Starkiller Base. So it's big. How is it possible to power a weapon of this size? It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears. The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now. Our system is the next target. Oh my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed. Okay, how do we blow it up? There's always a way to do that. Han's right. In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator... There is one. Precinct 47. Here. If we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon. ... Maybe the planet. We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got. They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate. We disable the shields. Kid, you worked there, what do you got? I can do it. I like this guy. I can disable the shields. But I have to be there, on the planet-- We'll get you there. Han, how? If I told you, you wouldn't like it. So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go! Chewie, check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives. Now you tell me? No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave. That's what I did it. So you'd miss me. I did miss you. It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was...good. ... Pretty good. Some things never change. True. You still drive me crazy. If you see our son again, bring him home. Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. We're searching the area. She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes. How are we getting in? Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through. Finn is suddenly filled with dread. We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?! Alright, Chewie, get ready. And Now! I AM PULLING UP!!! I get any higher, they'll see us! And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees! Sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert. Put every hangar on lock-down. She's going to try to steal a ship to-- Han Solo... The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. We'll get in that way. What was your job when you were based here? Sanitation. Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields? I don't. I'm just here to get Rey. People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--! Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force! That's not how the Force works--! Oh really, you're cold? Come on! Report. Weapon charged in fifteen minutes, sir. Hey! The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. The shields? I have an idea about that. Han and Chewie follow Finn. Remember me? FN-2187. Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge. Bring it down. Bring it down. Follow me. You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields. You're making a big mistake. Do it. Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey. Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her. You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all. I disagree. What do we do with her? Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor? Yeah, there is... General, their shields are down! Thank the Maker! Han did it! Send them in! Give Poe full authorization to attack. Black Leader, go to sub-lights. On your call. Roger, base -- red squad, blue squad, take my lead. Dropping out of lightspeed. Almost in range! Hit the target dead center, as many runs as we can get! Approaching target. Dispatch all squadrons... Yes, General. Let's light it up! Direct hit! But no damage! Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it! Another bombing run! Remember, when that sun is gone, that weapon will be ready to fire! But as long as there's light, we got a chance. Guys, we got a lot of company! We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover. You sure you're up for this? Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey -- -- The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- Why are you doing that? Why are you doing -- this? I'm trying to come up with a plan. The Oscillator's still standing. X-wings coming back for another round of attacks! Are you all right? Yeah. Good. What happened -- did he hurt you? Finn. What are you doing here?! We came back for you. What'd he say? ... That it was your idea. Thank you. How did you get away? I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it. Escape now. Hug later. I got one behind me. See it? Yeah, I'm on it! Furillo's been hit! Watch out for ground fire! They're in trouble. We can't leave. My friend here has a bag full of explosives. Let's use 'em. General, are you seeing this? Two more X-wings down. That's half our fleet destroyed. And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes! It would take a miracle to save us now. That girl knows her stuff. We'll set the charges at every other column. You're right. That's a better idea. You take the top. I'll go down below. Detonator. We'll meet back here. They head off in opposite directions. Find them. Ben! Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. Take off that mask. You don't need it. What do you think you'll see if I do? The face of my son. Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him. That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive. No. The Supreme Leader is wise. Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true. It's too late. No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you. I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me? Yes. Anything. Thank you. Solo. No, no. The Oscillator's been damaged but is still functional. COMMODORE META reacts. Admiral, their weapon will fire in two minutes. The Falcon's this way. We're not done yet. You're a monster! It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you. Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh no no no... TRAITOR! That lightsaber. It belongs to me! Come get it. We just lost R-1! We're overwhelmed! What do we do? It isn't working! Black Leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. Looks like our friends got in! Red Four! Red Six! Cover us! I'm on it! Roger! Everybody else, hit the target hard! Give it everything you got! I need some help here! I need some help! I'm coming in! Watch out! I'm hit! All teams - I'm going in! Pull up and cover me! Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck, Poe! Prepare to fire. You need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force! The Force. Lieutenant, get back to your station! Just look. We won't survive -- even Hux has gone! Supreme Leader. The fuel cells have ruptured. The collapse of the planet has begun. Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren. It is time to complete his training. Finn! Finn... All teams! I got eyes on them! Yes! Our job's done here. Let's go home! Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a heartbeat. R2-D2! You've come back! You foundwhat? How dare you call me that! Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We must go tell the others at once! General? Excuse me, General? Leia turns to see droids. R2-D2 may contain some much needed good news. Tell me. Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on -- Oh! The map! It is complete! -- Luke -- Oh my dear friend. How I've missed you. We'll see each other again. I believe that. Thank you, my friend. Rey. May the Force be with you.",
